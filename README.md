# ðŸ©º Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the possibility of various diseases based on patient medical data. It applies machine learning classification algorithms to structured datasets and helps in early disease detection and decision support.

## Objective
To build an intelligent system that can predict disease outcomes using patient attributes such as symptoms, age, and test results.

## Features
- Predicts diseases based on patient health data  
- Uses multiple classification algorithms for comparison  
- Supports datasets like Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Breast Cancer  
- Provides model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- XGBoost  

## Algorithms Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

## How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the medical dataset  
2. Split data into training and testing sets  
3. Train different classification models  
4. Evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
5. Predict disease likelihood for new patient data  

## Datasets
- Heart Disease Dataset  
- Diabetes Dataset  
- Breast Cancer Dataset  
(Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Applications
- Early disease detection  
- Clinical decision support systems  
- Health risk assessment tools
